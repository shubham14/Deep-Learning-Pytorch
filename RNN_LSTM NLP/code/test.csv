the food is outstanding !,1
the skillet paella dish has been removed .,0
i should have gotten my money back .,0

"the food is always fresh and its quality , consistent .",1
"the drive thru was packed , so i walked in .",0
just wanted to compliment the staff for the great service this past weekend .,1
the property is beautiful and there is so much to see and enjoy .,1
the staff is always friendly and i never have to wait in line .,1
"now , i have no ac and they are n't offering much to help !",0
hope i do n't get sick !,0
the next day i called back to cancel my original reservation and number count .,0
the best brewery i 've ever been to .,1
so i said `` thank you '' and walked away quickly .,0
there is only one old guy who actually knows what he 's talking about .,0
this is my second time here and everything was perfect - again .,1
avoid this like the plague .,0
why can you not pay their overpriced bills with a credit card .,0
four peaks serves up some great beers and great eats .,1
refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation .,0
"however when the check arrived , the appetizer was charged .",0

"what a wonderful experience , thank you .",1
i had to call them _num_ hours later to see if it was done .,0
"i recommend coming here for the lunch specials , which are very reasonably priced .",1

i came here a few days ago with my team from work .,1
a bit heavy but delicious .,1

the fries were limp and had absolutely no salt .,0
otherwise we love it .,1
still worth it though .,1
my boyfriend and i went in the store this evening and received bad service .,0
